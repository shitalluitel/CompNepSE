# CompNepSE

This application is used to compare different paramaters of
share within Nepali share market. Basically this application 
scraps data from three different websites and represent those 
data using excel files.

To achieve this feature we have used packages like BeautiFulSoup,
Request, and Pandas. 

I am looking forward for any help to make my code stable or to convert 
this small piece of code into library.

Thank You.
